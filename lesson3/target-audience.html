      <h2>Target Audience</h2>
         <p>"What's the weather" is for the residents and communities of Preston, Soda Springs, 
             and Fish Haven.  The people in these communities participate in a variety of jobs, and
             recreational activies.  There are students, families and professionals who all need to 
             know how to plan not only their day but their week.  They need to know how to dress and 
             whether or not to bring an umbrella.  
        </p>
        <h2>Persona 1:</h2>
        <p>
            A family is planning a camping trip in the spring.  They want to hike, fish, and roast 
            marshmallows over the fire.  Since the spring has unreliable weather they need to know if 
            they should bring their camping trailer, or if they can use tents.  Do they need to pack 
            extra blankets, coats and other cold weather items?  Or will they be needing hiking gear, 
            suncreen and hammocks?
        </p>
        <h2>Persona 2:</h2>
        <p>
            A young professional is starting their new job.  They want to impress their new bosses, coworkers,
            and potential clients.  They need to know if they need to buy and wear business clothes suitable 
            for the cold or a warm day.  Would need a water resistant overcoat to protect their clothes?  A way 
            to keep their laptops dry?
