        <p>I chose this website because I felt like it is a good example of alignment.
        Everything, including the header, logo, and pictures seem to all be be aligned 
        to the left.  They made all of the spacing between pictures and items in the 
        header equal.  Even the menu box lines up with the pictures.

        <p>This website is a good example for contrast.  I really liked the simplicity of 
          the bold colors of the food against the white background.  This tells me that the food is the most important thing on the page. The only other use of 
          bold color is the title of the website(blog) which makes it really stand out and 
          is more memorable.

        <p>There are a few things on this website that show good use of repetition.  First
          the name Mel is in a different font and so listing it in multiple places 
          tells me that it is important and should be remembered.  She also used the same color 
          of blue and fonts that help it feel cohesive.
